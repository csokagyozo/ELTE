/*
6.4. Write a function that returns the sum of the elements in an array received as a parameter. The array is passed using a pointer to the first element and an integer variable containing a length. Let's write the function without using the operator[], using pointer arithmetic.
6.5. Redesign the previous function so that we get the array using a pointer to the first element and a pointer to the last element.
6.6. Redesign the previous program to calculate an average. How can we calculate the size of the array from the pair of pointers?
